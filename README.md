# Smokaha Website

This repository contains the source code for **Smokaha**, a static website for a smoke shop. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides pages for various product categories such as cigarettes, cigars, disposable vapes, nicotine pouches, herb concentrate, and more.

## Project Structure

```
- index.html               # Home page
- contact-us.html          # Contact form and store location map
- assets/
  - css/                   # Stylesheets (style.css and style-prefix.css)
  - js/                    # Client-side JavaScript
  - images/                # Icons, logos and product images
- [brand folders]          # Category pages for specific products
```

All pages include a shared `header.html` file for the navigation menu. JavaScript in `assets/js/script.js` handles mobile navigation, modals, and a simple age verification popup.

## Running Locally

The site is completely static and does not require a backend server. You can view it by opening `index.html` in a browser. For a smoother experience with relative links, you may run a lightweight local server, for example using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Age Restriction Notice

The site contains references to tobacco and nicotine products. The builtâ€‘in age verification script requires visitors to confirm they are 21 or older. Ensure compliance with your local laws before deploying or modifying this code.
